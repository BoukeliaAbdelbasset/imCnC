# imCnC
<h1> imCnC : an Integrative approach based on Multisource Convolutional neural networks for Non-coding RNA Classification </h1>
<paragraph> a novel approach named imCnC for ncRNA classification based on multisource deep learning, which integrates several data sources such as genomic and epigenomic data to identify several ncRNA types.   </paragraph>
